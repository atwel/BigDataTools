With new modules written by Jon Atwell

============

This is a collection of YET EVOLVING labs written to introduce students to computational social science. 
Doing so requires teaching some basics of programming, data collection, analysis and thinking like a social
science. That is a lot to cover and my efforts to date are just preliminary. The first two modules (Facebook 
and Craigslist) are not fully functional at this point because the sites changed privacy policy and/or page 
layouts. They still have some utility for learning how to do something, but aren't helpful for the novice user.

A redesigned and more robust set of labs will be available in the future, likely the fall of 2015.
